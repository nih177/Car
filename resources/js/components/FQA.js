                            A credit reference search will be carried out and a credit score will be calculated, which will determine if we can offer
                            you a loan. We'll phone you if we have any more questions. If your loan is agreed in principle, we will try and contact
                            you over the phone to let you know. We will send your finance documents to be signed and returned to us along with any
                            additional information required to support your application. After returning your documents to us, your loan will be
                            processed for payment by EFT to the vendors nominated bank account.
