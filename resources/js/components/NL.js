                            <p>
                                A Novated Lease is a three-way arrangement, between a financier, employer and the employee. The employee chooses the vehicle and the finance company 'novates' this agreement to the employer. The employer assumes responsibility for the monthly lease payments, and is deducted out of the employees gross salary (before tax). This car can be driven for both business and personal use; it offers great benefits to both the employee and the employer.</p>
