                            <p>
                                With a Finance Lease the financier purchases the car required by the customer and then leases it to the customer. The customer pays a rental to the financier to use the car. At the end of the agreed rental period the customer can return the car which will be sold at auction or the financier may offer to sell the car to the customer.</p>

                                    Under a Finance Lease, the financier is the purchaser and owner of the asset and hence is entitled to claim the Input tax Credit (ITC). The amount financed on the car will be net of the ITC claimed by the financier. GST is payable on the rental payments over the life of the contract and the residual amount.</li>
                                <li>
                                    GST is paid on all fees and charges.</li>
